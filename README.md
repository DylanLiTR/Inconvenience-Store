Inconvenience Store is a platforming game where you have to fulfill customer orders as fast as you can before time runs out!

Jump up the store's platforms and avoid the shopping carts to get to those hard-to-reach items! Carry up to 3 items at once, but make sure to deposit the items at the front desk quickly, as orders keep piling up the longer you take! If you pick up the wrong items and run out of space, there's always the trash can, but only if you want to get rid of all your items :) Have fun!
